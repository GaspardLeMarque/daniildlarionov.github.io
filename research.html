            <p class="par"> <strong>Full Surplus Extraction from Colluding Bidders  <i> (Job Market Paper, draft coming soon) </i> </strong> </p>

            <p class="par">     I consider a repeated auction setting with colluding buyers and a seller who adjusts reserve prices
                          over time without long term commitment. Studying this problem necessitates a new equilibrium
                          concept: <i>collusive public perfect equilibrium (cPPE)</i> designed to model the seller's concerns for
                          collusion. For every strategy of the seller I define the corresponding <i>"buyer-game"</i> in which the
                          seller is replaced by Nature who chooses the reserve prices for the buyers in accordance with
                          the seller's strategy. A public perfect equilibrium is collusive if the buyers cannot achieve a
                          higher symmetric public perfect equilibrium payoff in the corresponding buyer-game. Assuming
                          symmetric buyers with private binary <i>iid</i> valuations and public revelation of bids, I find a
                          seller-optimal stationary cPPE which allows the seller to extract the entire surplus from the buyers in
                          the limit as the discount factor goes to 1, thus showing that a patient non-committed seller
                          can effectively fight collusion among the buyers even when she can only affect reserve prices and
                          has to satisfy stringent public disclosure requirements.       </p>
